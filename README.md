This repository contains the first stage of a student project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. This stage implements a backend console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.
